 ABOUT THE PROJECT 

The entire world is racing speedily towards digitization and the evolution of computers, especially 
the internet has affected to manually record management systems. Nowadays management systems 
are available for hospital and as well as other sectors. The aim of any Records Management System 
is the right information in the right place in the right order, at the right time for the right person at 
the lowest cost. But there are many hospital management and EHR [Electronic Health record 
systems available in the market. EHRs were never designed to manage multi-institutional, lifetime 
medical records. Medical records/data also played an important role for research. The greatest 
problem we came across was one of security. In studies, reflects that a security structure should be 
applied to the medical records. This Secure Health wallet implementation addresses the four issues 
highlighted: fragmented, slow access, system interoperability, improve data quality and quantity 
for medical research as well as patients. Data can be better integrated into daily care, and patients 
can play a role in curating their own data. Patients can own their data, check and compare their 
health records, and proactively communicate with their caregivers. A truly digital healthcare 
industry would revolutionize diagnosis and treatment, with a shift in focus to prevention and 
management. The most tangible, expected changes will be that care will move closer to the home, 
and citizens will have more responsibility for managing their own health and well-being. Digital 
healthcare has the potential to bring about not just small improvements in efficiency, but a step 
change in the productivity of the healthcare industry along with a significant impact on health 
outcomes 
This Health Care application will be like in an online Healthcare Management service provider 
with easy to use customizable options. The application is accessible from anywhere for all 
employees or staff of the hospital in private or at desktops or tablets etc. it will basically lessen the 
manual work and improves the quality of maintaining records and other information related to 
doctors or patients or billing etc. It reduces time frame in adding any info related to hospital and 
thereby reduce the complexity too.  The management system exploits a centralized database 
architecture that is fully interoperable with industry standard databases. This allows you to build 
upon the strengths of your existing platform and applications with minimal effort.
